# VetBot — Veterinary Equipment Online Store

A responsive, cross-browser website layout for a veterinary equipment supplier. I built a multi-page, adaptive UI from a custom design, including a product catalog, product detail, and a news/article template. The layout emphasizes clean navigation, structured content, and scalable components ready for backend integration.
